## Description


Here's your text with some spelling, grammar, and redaction corrections:

The grammar that I have chosen is a new notation for chess moves. Chess notation is a system used to record the moves played in a game of chess. In this system, each square on the board has a unique identifier based on a combination of a letter and a number. The letters represent the columns of the board, from "a" to "h", and the numbers represent the rows from 1 to 8.

For example, the movement of a pawn from the e2 square to the e4 square is written down as "e4". Another example is when a knight moves from the g1 square to the f3 square, then it is recorded as "Nf3", where "N" represents the knight.

In addition to moves, chess notation can also include special symbols and abbreviations to indicate different aspects of the game, such as check, checkmate, castling, piece captures, pawn promotions, among others.

However, for this evidence, I cannot use that notation because that would be analyzing a word, like the last evidence. Therefore, I decide to translate the chess notation to English.

Here are some examples of how this grammar may look:

Nf3 → white knight moves to f3 square.
Bxc6 → white bishop captures night on c6 square.
Qh5 → The white queen moves to h5 square.
O-O → White castles kingside (the king moves two squares to g1 and the rook moves to f1).
exd5 → The white pawn on the e-file captures on the d5 square.
Rd8 → The black rook moves to the d8 square.
Ne5+ → The white knight gives a check on the e5 square.

Yet, due to the complexity of chess, I had to shorten this grammar to only include pieces capturing other pieces, checkmate, and simple moves. I also allow illegal moves, such as pieces of the same color capturing themselves.

For this evidence, I will create a Restricted Context-Free Grammar (RCFG). As explained by Carol Critchlow & David J. Eck on the website eng.libretexts.org, a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) is a formal grammar that consists of a set of rewriting rules where each rule has a single non-terminal symbol on the left-hand side, which can be replaced by a sequence of symbols (terminal or non-terminal) on the right-hand side.

Here is a visual example using a screenshot from Critchlow, Carol & Eck, David J.'s work:
